# Preparing data for submission

To submit a data product to be released on the Jiutian Website, please prepare the following:

- readme.md, to document your data. See [pages/products/IDE.md](https://github.com/Kambrian/JiutianDR/blob/main/pages/products/IDE.md) for an example
- Your datafile, for example mydata.tgz, or mydata/myfile.tgz if you have many files. These data files will be referred to through data/mydata.tgz or data/mydata/myfile.tgz in your readme.md.
